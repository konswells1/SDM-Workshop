This figure conceptually represents how species distribution modelling (SDM) explores patterns of habitat suitability by linking species occurrence to environmental conditions. Scientific questions, such as ‘Which environmental factors influence bat presence?’, should guide the selection of predictors and model structure. These questions can be formalised using a generalised linear model (GLM), where presence–absence data are modelled as a function of habitat characteristics like forest type, or rainfall.","key":"fig-glm-illustration","order":{"number":1,"section":[0,1,0,0,0,0,0]}},{"caption":"Relationship between elevation and probability of occurrence for R. hipposideros under a logistic regression model.","key":"fig-glm-elev","order":{"number":2,"section":[0,1,1,0,0,0,0]}}],"headings":["fit-a-basic-binomial-glm-logistic-regression","fitting-the-first-glm-a-single-environmental-predictor","extending-the-glm-quadratic-response-curve","glms-with-multiple-predictors","example-glm-with-elevation-and-climate-variables","visualising-effects","model-diagnostics"]}

Having prepared occurrence, background, and environmental data, this section introduces a foundational yet flexible approach — the **generalised linear model (GLM)** to estimate habitat suitability for *Rhinolophus hipposideros* across the UK.\n\nSDMs quantify relationships between observed species distributions and environmental predictors, then project these relationships in space or time to identify potentially suitable areas under current or future conditions. While numerous algorithms exist, including MaxEnt, Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, and ensemble methods — the choice of model should reflect the modelling objective: inference, spatial prediction, or forecasting (Zurell et al. 2020).\n\nGLMs, despite being statistically \"simpler\" than many machine learning alternatives, remain widely used because they are interpretable, computationally efficient, and well-suited to presence–background data. However, building meaningful SDMs still requires rigorous conceptualisation:\n\nAre the data spatially biased or autocorrelated?\n\nAre predictor variables collinear or ecologically redundant?\n\nIs the model too simple or overly complex?\n\nAre we modelling for understanding, mapping, or future projection?\n\nIn this session, we will fit a logistic regression model using key bioclimatic and topographic predictors. You will explore how to interpret model coefficients, predict across environmental space, and visualise suitability maps. This exercise lays the foundation for more advanced techniques — including model validation, spatial transfer, and ensembling, which we will explore in subsequent sessions.\n\nFor further background, see foundational SDM texts such as [Elith & Leathwick (2009)](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159), and [Franklin (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00641.x), and methodological overviews and tutorials (e.g., [Zurell et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04960), [Araújo et al. 2019)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat4858)).\n\n<br>\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"info\"}\n### Model fitting is an iterative process\n\nWhile SDMs are often presented as a sequence of discrete steps — from data preparation to modelling and projection — the process is inherently iterative.\n\nFitting a model is rarely the endpoint. Often, model results reveal issues that require revisiting earlier decisions, such as:\n\nRe-examining environmental predictors (e.g., removing collinear or ecologically irrelevant variables)\n\nAdjusting background sampling to better reflect sampling bias\n\nFiltering or cleaning occurrence data more stringently\n\nRefining the study extent or resolution to match ecological realism\n\nEach modelling decision can influence not only model performance, but also ecological interpretation and predictive transferability. As such, iteration is not a failure — it's good modelling practice. Treat each round of model fitting as an opportunity to improve clarity, parsimony, and ecological relevance.\n\n📌 Think of model fitting not as a straight line, but as a feedback loop between conceptualisation, data, and interpretation.\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n## 1.

These questions can be formalised using a generalised linear model (GLM), where presence–absence data are modelled as a function of habitat characteristics like forest type, or rainfall.](images/glm_illustration.jpg){#fig-glm-illustration width=632}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"GLM refresher: Logistic regression basics\"}\nBefore applying generalised linear models (GLMs) in species distribution modelling, let’s briefly revisit the fundamentals of logistic regression — the most common approach for modelling binary outcomes, such as species presence or absence.\n\nPresence–absence data are common in ecological and environmental research, but also in many other domains, such as infection status in epidemiology or success/failure in behavioural studies. Logistic regression models the **probability** of an event (e.g., species presence) as a function of one or more predictors, using a logit link function to map probabilities to the real line.\n\nTo illustrate, we begin with a simple example — random presence–absence data simulated as Bernoulli trials:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Draw random binary outcomes (e.g., 10% chance of presence)\ny <- rbinom(50, 1, 0.1)\n\n# Observed mean presence probability\nmu_y <- mean(y)\nmu_y\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.06\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis observed mean can be estimated with a logistic regression model.

This approach improves model interpretability, reduces the risk of overfitting, and ensures that the number of parameters aligns with recommended sample sizes per parameter (Guisan et al., 2017).\n:::\n\n##### Example: GLM with elevation and climate variables\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit logistic regression with multiple predictors\nglm_multi_1 <- glm(pa ~ elevation + bio_1 + bio_12,\n                 data = sdm_df_clean,\n                 family = binomial)\n\n# Alternatively, fit logistic regression with multiple predictors as polynomial terms\nglm_multi <- glm(pa ~ poly(elevation, 2) + poly(bio_1, 2) + poly(bio_12, 2),\n                 data = sdm_df_clean,\n                 family = binomial)\n\nsummary(glm_multi)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = pa ~ poly(elevation, 2) + poly(bio_1, 2) + poly(bio_12, \n    2), family = binomial, data = sdm_df_clean)\n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate Std.

Use model selection (AIC, cross-validation) or regularisation methods to avoid this.\n\nAlways check whether fitted responses make ecological sense, not just statistical sense.\n\n### 1.4 Model diagnostics\n\nAfter fitting a GLM, it is essential to evaluate its performance and understand how well it captures species–environment relationships. Key diagnostics include **deviance, pseudo-R², and effect plots**.\n\n**Deviance** measures how well the model fits the observed data compared to a perfect (saturated) model. Lower deviance indicates better fit. **Pseudo-R²** provides an approximate measure of explained variation, similar to the R² statistic in linear regression, but adapted for models like GLMs. Different versions exist (e.g., McFadden’s), and they help quantify how much of the variation in the response is accounted for by the predictors. **Effect plots** visualise the relationship between predictor variables and the response, showing how changes in environmental variables affect predicted species occurrence or abundance. These plots aid interpretation by revealing the shape and strength of species–environment relationships.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Perform stepwise variable selection (forward/backward/both based on AIC)\nglm_step <- step(glm_multi, direction = \"both\", trace = FALSE)\n\n# Inspect selected model\nsummary(glm_step)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = pa ~ poly(elevation, 2) + poly(bio_1, 2) + poly(bio_12, \n    2), family = binomial, data = sdm_df_clean)\n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate Std.

Instead, they provide a **relative measure of habitat suitability** along environmental gradients.\n\nKey points to remember:\n\n-   Higher predicted values indicate more suitable conditions relative to other locations in the study area.\n-   The absolute scale depends on the ratio of presences to pseudo-absences or background points.\n-   Avoid interpreting predictions as exact probabilities of occurrence in the field.\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" icon=\"light-bulb\"}\n### Other SDM approaches: machine learning and advanced methods\n\nWhile GLMs offer interpretable models, many modern SDM studies use **machine learning (ML) algorithms** to capture complex, non-linear relationships and interactions among predictors. Common approaches include:\n\n-   **MaxEnt** – Uses presence-only data with background points; widely used for species distribution modelling.\n-   **Random Forests (RF)** – Ensemble of decision trees; handles non-linearities and interactions automatically.\n-   **Boosted Regression Trees (BRT / GBM)** – Sequential ensemble of weak learners to improve predictive performance.\n\nThese methods are particularly useful when ecological responses are complex or highly non-linear. They complement GLMs and will be explored further in the **“SDM Ensemble Models”** section.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"info\"}\n### Exercises: Building and evaluating species–environment models\n\n1.  **Compare linear vs quadratic responses:**\\\n    Using the same species dataset, fit two GLMs: one with a single linear predictor (e.g., bio_1) and another with a second-order polynomial (poly(bio_1, 2)). Visualise both fits and compare their AIC values and response curves. Which model better captures the ecological response?\n\n2.  **Fit multivariable GLMs and assess collinearity:**\\\n    Select 4–5 bioclimatic and topographic predictors. Compute their pairwise correlation matrix, identify highly correlated pairs (e.g., \\|r\\| \\> 0.7), and remove or justify the inclusion of collinear variables. Fit a multivariable GLM and interpret the model coefficients and pseudo-R².\n\n3.  **Model with and without scaled predictors:**\\\n    Refit a GLM using 'scale()' to standardise all continuous predictors. Compare the resulting coefficients and diagnostic metrics with the unscaled model. Discuss how scaling affects interpretability, model convergence, and numerical stability, especially in models with interaction or quadratic terms.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"lightbulb\"}\n### Literature\n\nAraújo, M.B., Anderson, R.P., Márcia Barbosa, A., Beale, C.M., Dormann, C.F., Early, R., Garcia, R.A., Guisan, A., Maiorano, L., Naimi, B., O’Hara, R.B., Zimmermann, N.E. & Rahbek, C.
